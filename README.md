## More Commenting Options

 - Quote buttons for easy replying to comments.

## Feed Improvements

The update feed has been overhauled with more options to better control how you see your content.

- Fancy Feeds
  The new "Mixed View" display mode will only show the full content for unread items. Read items are collapsed to save space.
  Also highlights these items to make them visually distinct.
- Simple Feeds
  What with how many groups people join, and their propensity to hoard stories, I'm sure we're all tired of single stories taking up pages of the feed because it appeared in multiple folders.
  "Group by Stories" option switches these around so stories are listed at the top, with a compact line of folders below each one.
- Separated blogs
  Optional feature to move group icons to the right for a more balanced look.
  Some people might like this to easily tell what came from a group and what came from an author. All you have to do is scan down the corresponding side of the page!
- No more banding!
  The feed normally has colorcoding, but it never worked very well in my experience, so I've moved the colours to a spot where they're more easily identifiable without the white bands (content) breaking them up.
- Sticky Feed Options
  The feed options will stick to the top of the page when you scroll down so they're always easily accessible no matter how deep you go.

## Bug Fixes and Improvements

 There are various tweaks across the site to improve the overall look and feel.

 - Numerous Fixes for knighty's rather patchy css (knighty pls).
 - Adds a warning when clicking the publish/unpublish chapter button to prevent misclicks
 - Adds a box indicating where you can create a blog post when a user is viewing their blog and do not have any blogs already published
